There are 2 input files - 
1)The first one is a .txt file which consists of the production rules.
The first line of this file consists of 2 intergers - 
	a)The first one being the number of non terminals
	b)The second integer indicates the number of terminals.
The following lines contain the production rules labelled in order.
The non terminals are indicated by uppercase letters and the terminals by lowercase letters.
The symbol ':' is used instead of -> to denote the productions.

2)The second file is a .csv file which contains the parse table for the corresponding grammar.
acc is used instead of 'accept' . The shift and reduce operations are labelled corresponding to the number of the production rule 
in the .txt file . Eg. r4 means a reduce operation using production rule 4 from the txt file.
